# Substack Draft Format

Use this output shape:

1. Headline (single line, high curiosity, clear value)
2. Two short intro paragraphs (2-3 sentences total)
3. 3 bullet takeaways from the video
4. Embedded video block (YouTube URL on its own line, exact source video)
5. 1 CTA line (subscribe/reply/share)

## Minimal Template

```md
# [Eye-catching headline]

[Short paragraph with core insight and why it matters now.]

[Short paragraph with what readers will get from the video.]

- [Takeaway 1]
- [Takeaway 2]
- [Takeaway 3]

[CTA: subscribe, reply, or forward this post.]
```

## Notes

- Keep total length tight (roughly 120-260 words unless user asks otherwise).
- Write in plain language, no filler.
- Avoid emojis unless user requests them.
- If the URL is missing or malformed, keep as draft and notify before publishing.
