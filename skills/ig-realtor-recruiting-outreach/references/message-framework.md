# IG Realtor Recruiting Message Framework

Use this order in every sequence:

1. Observation
2. Relevance
3. Low-pressure CTA

## Stage Prompts

- `d1_opener`: Personal note + 1 sentence on recruiting angle.
- `f1_value`: One concrete value proposition tied to lead profile.
- `f2_story`: Short proof point without hard claims.
- `breakup`: Respectful close + open door.

## Brokerage Angle

- eXp Realty: Position around rev share model, cloud brokerage flexibility, and agent ownership mindset.
- Real Broker: Position around modern tech stack, collaborative culture, and attraction economics.
- Generic: Position around support, systems, and team-building upside.

## Tone

- Direct, calm, peer-to-peer.
- No hype words.
- Keep each message short enough for IG DM readability.
